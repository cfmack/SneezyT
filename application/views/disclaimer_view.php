        We want to make this a better world for all who suffer from Food Allergies and Eosinophilic Disorders. We are not doctors, we are just parents with a passion for helping those who suffer. We have spent hundreds of hours creating this application and blog in our free time in the hopes that we can help others who are in our same boat. We'd LOVE to have people contribute code to help make this a better product. We have open sourced the entire package. Please reach out, if you want to contribute. If you like this application, a recipe, or some comic relief that you've received as a result of our efforts, please donate money to our paypal account to help us keep up the administrative fees associated with hosting this site. Half of all the donations to our paypal account will be sent to the <a href="http://apfed.org/drupal/drupal/index.php">American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders (APFED)</a> in the hopes that we will find a cure for those suffering with Eosinophilic Disorders.
