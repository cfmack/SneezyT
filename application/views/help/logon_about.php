<h1>Sneezy T's Food Tracker</h1>
<p>
This is an app that tracks food and symptoms associated with Food Allergies and Gastrointestinal Disorders, such as Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE).  With this application, you can track the diet of multiple
people and their reactions.  Reactions include vomiting, hives, or other external symptoms.  Additionally, you can track the medicine used to treat a reaction and environmental pollens

This app is currently provided by a family who has personal struggles with EoE and food allergies of our son.  You can read about our adventures on our blog: <a href="sneezty.wordpress.com">sneezty.wordpress.com</a>
